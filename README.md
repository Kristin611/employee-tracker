# Employee Tracker Application

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to apply MySQL skills, which involves building databases with tables, and seeding those tables with data. 

For this assignment, I built an application that tracks employee data like departments, roles, and salaries. Users of the app are able to view, add, and update employees, departments, and roles. 

Technologies used to build the application were MySQL, Inquirer, and Node.js.
